# Automatically start a configured serial console
#
# How this works:
#
# On boot, a udev helper examines /dev/console. If a serial console is the
# primary console (last console on the commandline in grub),  the event
# 'fedora.serial-console-available <port name> <speed>' is emitted, which
# triggers this script. It waits for the runlevel to finish, ensures
# the proper port is in /etc/securetty, and starts the getty.
#
# If your serial console is not the primary console, or you want a getty
# on serial even if it's not the console, create your own event e.g. 
# /etc/init/ttyS0.conf with content:
# # ttyS0 - agetty
# #
# # This service maintains a agetty on ttyS0.
#
# stop on runlevel [S016]
# start on runlevel [23]
#
# respawn
# exec agetty -h -L -w /dev/ttyS0 115200 vt102
#
# Do not edit this file directly. If you want to change the behaviour,
# please create a file serial.override and put your changes there.
