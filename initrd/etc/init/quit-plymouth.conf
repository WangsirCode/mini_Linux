# quit-plymouth - script to stop boot splash
#
# This service triggers plymouth to quit when we reach the
# end of the boot cycle. We start on 'stopping rcX' to make sure
# this completes before the getty starts.
# prefdm handles quit differently, though.
#
# Do not edit this file directly. If you want to change the behaviour,
# please create a file quit-plymouth.override and put your changes there.
